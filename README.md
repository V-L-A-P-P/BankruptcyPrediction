# Neural Lexus â€” Company Bankruptcy Prediction

A machine learning project aimed at **predicting the probability of company bankruptcy** using financial indicators, macroeconomic variables, and industry trends. The model is built using **CatBoost**

## Project Description

Bankruptcy risk assessment is a crucial task for banks, investors, insurers, and businesses. Our goal is to build an accurate and interpretable model to help stakeholders anticipate potential bankruptcies and minimize financial losses.

## Project Goal

- Develop a machine learning model for bankruptcy prediction.
- Integrate macroeconomic and industry data into the prediction pipeline.
- Improve risk analysis in corporate systems.

---

## Target Audience

- Banks and financial institutions  
- Investment funds  
- Insurance companies  
- Medium and large enterprises  

---

## Techstack

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- CatBoost  
- Scikit-learn (for metrics and evaluation)
- Optuna (Bayesian optimization) 
- Jupyter Notebook

## The Model

We used the **CatBoostClassifier**, a gradient boosting algorithm developed by Yandex, known for its strong performance on tabular data, native support for categorical features, and robust generalization on small-to-medium-sized datasets.

#### Why CatBoost?

- Handles categorical features without manual encoding  
- Requires minimal preprocessing  
- Delivers high prediction accuracy  
- Resistant to overfitting due to built-in regularization
